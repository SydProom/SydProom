Hi, Iâ€™m Syd Proom

I'm a 4th year MMath Mathematics student at Nottingham Trent University and currently doing a Machine Learning project to train an Autonomous Vehicle to drive itself.

I am relatively new to coding in Python, but it is something I have been waiting a long time to learn and now is the best time.
